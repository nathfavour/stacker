Perhaps these are some of the most appealing features of stacker:

1. Clone this repo and everything is already setup completely offline. This is useful in cases where one just wants to perform simple offline based code auditing and editing.
2. Stacker itself can generate new projects, both offline and online based
3. Stacker can help you find changes made between a template and a final piece of code.


Getting started:

1. To get started, simply download this repo. Cloning is not really a good idea, due to the repo's large size. Stacker rarely gets updated so you can be confident it will take sometime before new stacker versions are available.
